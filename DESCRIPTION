Description: We propose a transfer learning (TL) based method (PRS-PGx-TL) that 
    jointly models large-scale disease GWAS summary statistics 
    from the base (training) cohort and individual-level PGx data from the target cohort, 
    leveraging both for learning parameter optimization and prognostic and predictive PRS construction.
